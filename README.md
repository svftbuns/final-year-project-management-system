# Final-Year-Project Management System

This project is our SC2002 Object Oriented Design and Programming Assignment. We created a Final Year Projects (FYP) Management System which facilitates the creation, registration, de-registration and updates of FYPs. Depending on whether the user is a student, supervisor or FYP Coordinator, a user is only entitled to a specific set of privileges which determines the functions he/she can employ. 

With the SOLID design principles in mind, we created a OODP system that is modular, extensible and highly maintainable. This allows us to extend the system to handle other related fields such as Research Projects, which is something we can explore in the future.
